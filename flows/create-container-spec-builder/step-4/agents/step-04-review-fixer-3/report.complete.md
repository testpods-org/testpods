# Step 4 status: Completed

The third reviewer's verdict was **APPROVED** with all checks passing. All 217 core module tests pass with BUILD SUCCESS, Spotless formatting is compliant (0 violations), and the GenericTestPod migration to ContainerSpec correctly implements the spec plan requirements. Since the review was APPROVED, no code fixes were required - this review-fixer pass confirms the implementation is production-ready.

## Summary

- Analyzed the third reviewer's report - verdict was APPROVED with no issues identified
- Independently verified all 217 core module tests pass with BUILD SUCCESS
- Independently verified Spotless formatting compliance (0 files need changes, 75 files clean via `mvn spotless:check -pl core`)
- No code modifications required since review was APPROVED
- Appended third review-fixer entry to implementation-log.md documenting the clean pass

## Deferred responsibilities

None - all responsibilities for this step were completed.
