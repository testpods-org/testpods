#### Step N Description
{Detailed description of what to implement}

Include:
- Files to create or modify
- Pseudo-code for complex logic (labeled: "pseudo-code - builders must write actual implementation")

- Dependencies on other steps

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include implementation code. Only use:
- Type signatures
- Pseudo-code (clearly labeled)
- API references
-->
